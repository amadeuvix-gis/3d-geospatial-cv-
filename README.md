# 🗺️ 3D Geospatial Career Portfolio
### Interactive GeoBIM & GIS Showcase | Luiz Amadeu Coutinho

This project is a high-fidelity 3D geospatial application built with the **ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript**. It serves as an interactive curriculum vitae, visualizing over 20 years of global experience in GIS, GeoBIM, and Reality Capture across Brazil, USA, Portugal, Angola, South Africa, and Ireland.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features

### 1. Dynamic 3D Navigation
* **Automated Career Tour:** An optimized "instant-start" navigation system that flies the camera through professional milestones with specific tilt and heading adjustments.
* **Responsive Camera Offsets:** Advanced logic that adjusts the focal point based on the device (Mobile vs. Desktop) to ensure visibility above UI overlays.

### 2. Advanced Data Filtering
* **Bi-directional Sync:** Filtering by Country or Career Level updates both the sidebar list and the map features simultaneously.
* **SQL-based Expressions:** Utilizes `definitionExpression` to physically filter GeoJSON features on the client-side, ensuring a clean and focused map view.

### 3. Professional UX/UI
* **Mobile-First Approach:** A custom "Bottom Sheet" layout for mobile devices with a toggleable (**Minimize/Maximize**) sidebar.
* **Custom Theming:** Dark-mode interface with customized ArcGIS widgets including **Daylight**, **Basemap Gallery**, and **Measurement Tools**.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Engine:** [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript v4.29](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/)
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data:** Standalone GeoJSON dataset for decoupled data management.
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages.
